# MapsIndoors Showcase Web App
A [MapsIndoors](https://www.mapspeople.com/mapsindoors/) powered showcase app free to use and adapt to your needs.

## Getting Started

The Showcase Web App is based on [Angular](https://angular.io/), which requires [Node.js/NPM to be installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). For development, we recommend that you install [Angular CLI globally](https://angular.io/cli#installing-angular-cli).

Using a terminal/shell in the project folder, run the following commands:

* Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

* Run `npm start` to start a server on your machine which serves the Web App.

* Open http://localhost:4200 in your browser and enter your Solution ID in the dialogue.
  * You can also open the URL with your Solution ID appended, eg. `http://localhost:4200/demo`.

* The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
